  <strong>NewPipe x SponsorBlock</strong> is a fork of <a href="https://newpipe.net">NewPipe</a> with <a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app">SponsorBlock</a> integrated to help you skip sponsored advertisements.
  It also has some experimental settings such as the ability to use the built-in player for local playback, an option to force fullscreen on landscape mode, and an option to disable error reporting prompts.

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  This fork is not endorsed by or affiliated with the upstream project. The NewPipe team has <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3205">rejected</a> integration with SponsorBlock and thus this fork is created to provide this functionality.
